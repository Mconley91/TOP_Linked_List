# TOP_Linked_List
A TOP assignment showcasing the implementation of a linked list data structure in Ruby.

The file is executed from lib/main.rb.

instances of the LinkedList class have the following functioning methods:

#append(value), adds a new node to the end of the list and establishes that node as the new 'tail' of the list.

#prepend(value), adds a new node to the beginning of the list and establishes that node as the new 'head' of the list.

#size, returns the length of the node list as an integer.

#head, returns the current 'head' node of the list.

#tail, returns the current 'tail' node of the list.

#at(index), returns the node at the given index position if it exists.

#pop, removes the last node from the list and returns it.

#contains?(value), returns a boolean depending on whether a node within the list contains a given value.

#find(value), returns the the index of the first node containing a given value, or nil if no such node exists.

#to_s, prints a representation of the current linked list to the terminal.

#insert_at(value, index), inserts a new node at the given index position, displaced nodes are moved toward the end of the list.

#remove_at(index), removes a node at the given index from the linked list.
